# CS 3240 Project Repo
Created in Fall 2022 Semester at UVA in CS 3240: Advanced Software Development Techinques
Works with Django Framework, created using Django documentation on a team with 4 other people. We worked evenly on most parts of the project, some more than others. I worked on the development for some of the different features such as: Creating the project using Django, connecting to UVA's "Luther's List API", using Google's login feature, Search for Courses/Posts function, HTML on pages like Home, Create a Listing, Search for Courses/Posts.
